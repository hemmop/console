"console" is an application for accessing remote devices
out of band (OOB) through Reverse Telnet type of console
servers.

The actual mapping from hostnames to console server and
port is stored as an TXT RR in DNS for all hosts. Cases
where a device have more than one OOB connection are also
supported.

A typical DNS entry for a device looks like:

router	  A    10.1.1.1
	  AAAA 2001:db8::10:1:1:1
	  TXT "OOB:consoleserver1,2001"


The console server tested is Cisco 2511 running IOS 12.0(28c)
with the following configuration:

aaa new-model
aaa authentication login line_auth none
!
line 1 16
 session-timeout 60 
 no exec
 absolute-timeout 180
 login authentication line_auth
 transport input telnet
!
end
